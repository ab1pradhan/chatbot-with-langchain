      "Q) Which scooter has the best mileage?\n",
      "A) The two most popular scooter segments in India are 110cc and 125cc. Between the two, 110cc scooters are more frugal. Some of the most fuel-efficient 110cc scooters on sale are the Honda Activa 6G, TVS Jupiter, TVS Scooty and the Honda Dio.\n",
      "Q) Which scooter is best for daily use?\n",
      "A) The popularity of automatic scooters can be attributed to their ease of use and versatility. All scooters are good for daily use but you should make a choice based on your budget, usage, fuel efficiency and comfort.\n",
      "Q) How long do scooter engines last?\n",
      "A) Given the advancement of technology, all modern scooters from different brands are fairly reliable but it also depends on the user. Ensure the motor is serviced regularly and in case of any problems, get them fixed by qualified technicians.\n",
      "Q) Can scooters go long distances?\n",
      "A) Just like any other two-wheeler, scooters can also cover long distances. However, they aren’t as comfortable as motorcycles as they’ve been designed for city commutes and have a comparatively smaller fuel tank.\n",
      "Q) What is the average mileage of scooters?\n",
      "A) The mileage of a scooter depends on its displacement and the manner in which it’s ridden. Most 110cc scooters offer a mileage between 45 and 50kmpl, while for 125cc scooters it’s between 35 and 45kmpl.\n",
      "Q) Are scooters better than bikes?\n",
      "A) Both motorcycles and scooters have their advantages and disadvantages. Unlike conventional motorcycles that have a manual gearbox, scooters sold in India have automatic transmissions. Another advantage of scooters is their lower seat height which makes it comfortable even for female riders wearing a saree.\n",

Between the two, 110cc scooters are more frugal. Some of the most fuel-efficient 110cc scooters on sale are the Honda Activa 6G, TVS Jupiter, TVS Scooty and the Honda Dio.Q) Which scooter is best for daily use?A) The popularity of automatic scooters can be attributed to their ease of use and versatility. All scooters are good for daily use but you should make a choice based on your budget, usage, fuel efficiency and comfort.\\xa0Q) How long do scooter engines last?A) Given the advancement of technology, all modern scooters from different brands are fairly reliable but it also depends on the user. Ensure the motor is serviced regularly and in case of any problems, get them fixed by qualified technicians.Q) Can scooters go long distances?A) Just like any other two-wheeler, scooters can also cover long distances. However, they aren’t as comfortable as motorcycles as they’ve been designed for city commutes and have a comparatively smaller fuel tank.Q) What is the average mileage of scooters?A) The mileage of a scooter depends on its displacement and the manner in which it’s ridden.\\xa0Most 110cc scooters offer a mileage between 45 and 50kmpl, while for 125cc scooters it’s between 35 and 45kmpl.Q) Are scooters better than bikes?A) Both motorcycles and scooters have their advantages and disadvantages. Unlike conventional motorcycles that have a manual gearbox, scooters sold in India have automatic transmissions. Another advantage of scooters is their lower seat height which makes it comfortable even for female riders wearing a saree.Top Scooters Comparisons VSBgauss C12iRs.99,990 - 1.30 Lakh *Ampere Magnus EXsponsoredRs.84,900 *Know MoreVSHonda Activa 6GRs.80,977 - 94,998 *TVS JupiterRs.77,291 - 90,441 *Activa 6G vs JupiterVSBajaj ChetakRs.99,990 - 1.46 Lakh *TVS iQubeRs.94,434 - 1.31 Lakh *Chetak vs iQubeVSHonda Activa 6GRs.80,977 - 94,998 *Honda Activa 7GRs.79,000 *Activa 6G vs Activa 7GVSTVS iQubeRs.94,434 - 1.31 Lakh *Ola S1 ProRs.1.16 - 1.36 Lakh *iQube vs S1 Pro Start a New Scooter ComparisonBest E Scooters/Scooty  Bajaj ChetakRs.99,990 - 1.46 Lakh*Yulu WynnRs.55,555*TVS iQubeRs.94,434 - 1.31 Lakh*Ola S1 ProRs.1.16 - 1.36 Lakh*Honda Activa eRs.1.17 - 1.52 Lakh*Electric ScootersNews & Articles around Popular Scooter Recent NewsBike CollectionsAther 450X Long Term Report: IntroductionI took ‘delivery’ of ‘my’ 2025 Ather 450X in the new Stealth Blue colour,...The Weekly Bike News Wrap-up: Bajaj Chetak, Royal Enfield Bullet And Many MoreA lot of things happened this week including launches of some exciting two-wheelers.

      "Q) Which scooter has the best mileage?\n",
      "A) The two most popular scooter segments in India are 110cc and 125cc. Between the two, 110cc scooters are more frugal. Some of the most fuel-efficient 110cc scooters on sale are the Honda Activa 6G, TVS Jupiter, TVS Scooty and the Honda Dio.\n",
      "Q) Which scooter is best for daily use?\n",
      "A) The popularity of automatic scooters can be attributed to their ease of use and versatility. All scooters are good for daily use but you should make a choice based on your budget, usage, fuel efficiency and comfort.\n",
      "Q) How long do scooter engines last?\n",
      "A) Given the advancement of technology, all modern scooters from different brands are fairly reliable but it also depends on the user. Ensure the motor is serviced regularly and in case of any problems, get them fixed by qualified technicians.\n",
      "Q) Can scooters go long distances?\n",
      "A) Just like any other two-wheeler, scooters can also cover long distances. However, they aren’t as comfortable as motorcycles as they’ve been designed for city commutes and have a comparatively smaller fuel tank.\n",
      "Q) What is the average mileage of scooters?\n",
      "A) The mileage of a scooter depends on its displacement and the manner in which it’s ridden. Most 110cc scooters offer a mileage between 45 and 50kmpl, while for 125cc scooters it’s between 35 and 45kmpl.\n",
      "Q) Are scooters better than bikes?\n",
      "A) Both motorcycles and scooters have their advantages and disadvantages. Unlike conventional motorcycles that have a manual gearbox, scooters sold in India have automatic transmissions. Another advantage of scooters is their lower seat height which makes it comfortable even for female riders wearing a saree.\n",

Between the two, 110cc scooters are more frugal. Some of the most fuel-efficient 110cc scooters on sale are the Honda Activa 6G, TVS Jupiter, TVS Scooty and the Honda Dio.\\nQ) Which scooter is best for daily use?\\nA) The popularity of automatic scooters can be attributed to their ease of use and versatility. All scooters are good for daily use but you should make a choice based on your budget, usage, fuel efficiency and comfort.\\nQ) How long do scooter engines last?\\nA) Given the advancement of technology, all modern scooters from different brands are fairly reliable but it also depends on the user. Ensure the motor is serviced regularly and in case of any problems, get them fixed by qualified technicians.\\nQ) Can scooters go long distances?\\nA) Just like any other two-wheeler, scooters can also cover long distances. However, they aren’t as comfortable as motorcycles as they’ve been designed for city commutes and have a comparatively smaller fuel tank.\\nQ) What is the average mileage of scooters?\\nA) The mileage of a scooter depends on its displacement and the manner in which it’s ridden.\\xa0Most 110cc scooters offer a mileage between 45 and 50kmpl, while for 125cc scooters it’s between 35 and 45kmpl.\\nQ) Are scooters better than bikes?\\nA) Both motorcycles and scooters have their advantages and disadvantages. Unlike conventional motorcycles that have a manual gearbox, scooters sold in India have automatic transmissions. Another advantage of scooters is their lower seat height which makes it comfortable even for female riders wearing a saree.\\nTop Scooters Comparisons\\nVS\\nBgauss C12i\\nRs.\\n99,990 - 1.30 Lakh\\n*\\nAmpere Magnus EX\\nsponsored\\nRs.\\n84,900\\n*\\nKnow More\\nVS\\nHonda Activa 6G\\nRs.\\n80,977 - 94,998\\n*\\nTVS Jupiter\\nRs.\\n77,291 - 90,441\\n*\\nActiva 6G vs Jupiter\\nVS\\nBajaj Chetak\\nRs.\\n99,990 - 1.46 Lakh\\n*\\nTVS iQube\\nRs.\\n94,434 - 1.31 Lakh\\n*\\nChetak vs iQube\\nVS\\nHonda Activa 6G\\nRs.\\n80,977 - 94,998\\n*\\nHonda Activa 7G\\nRs.\\n79,000\\n*\\nActiva 6G vs Activa 7G\\nVS\\nTVS iQube\\nRs.\\n94,434 - 1.31 Lakh\\n*\\nOla S1 Pro\\nRs.\\n1.16 - 1.36 Lakh\\n*\\niQube vs S1 Pro\\nStart a New Scooter Comparison\\nBest E Scooters/Scooty\\nBajaj Chetak\\nRs.\\n99,990 - 1.46 Lakh\\n*\\nYulu Wynn\\nRs.\\n55,555\\n*\\nTVS iQube\\nRs.\\n94,434 - 1.31 Lakh\\n*\\nOla S1 Pro\\nRs.\\n1.16 - 1.36 Lakh\\n*\\nHonda Activa e\\nRs.\\n1.17 - 1.52 Lakh\\n*\\nElectric Scooters\\nNews & Articles around Popular Scooter\\nRecent News\\nBike Collections\\nThe Weekly Bike News Wrap-up: Bajaj Chetak, Royal Enfield Bullet And Many More\\nA lot of things happened this week including launches of some exciting two-wheelers.
